## 💪AI-Based Personalized Workout & Diet Planner ##

## 📌 Project Overview ##
The AI-Based Personalized Workout & Diet Planner is a web-based fitness recommendation system developed using Python and Streamlit. The application generates customized workout routines and diet plans tailored to individual users based on their body metrics, fitness goals, dietary preferences, budget constraints, and workout intensity levels.

Unlike generic fitness applications, this system focuses on student-friendly, culturally appropriate, and budget-conscious recommendations, making it highly practical for daily use.

This project was developed as part of an internship program to demonstrate applied skills in AI logic, data analysis, and interactive web application development.

## 🎯 Problem Statement ##
Most existing fitness applications provide one-size-fits-all workout and diet plans that:

1.Ignore individual health parameters (BMI, weight, age)

2.Do not consider Indian food habits

3.Suggest costly or impractical meal plans

4.Require gym access

Students need a personalized, affordable, and easy-to-use fitness planning system that adapts to real-world constraints.

## 💡 Proposed Solution ##

This project introduces an AI-driven rule-based fitness planner that:

1.Calculates BMI and health category

2.Generates detailed weekly workout plans

3.Adjusts workout intensity (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

4.Recommends budget-friendly Indian diet plans

5.Provides calorie and macronutrient breakdown

6.Tracks BMI progress over time

7.Allows users to download their personalized fitness plan
